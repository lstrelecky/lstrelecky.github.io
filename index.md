## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at Brown University, where I study computer science on a pre-med track. My coursework is focused mainly on computer systems, computational biology, and chemistry. My research focuses on large-scale analysis clinical outcomes using statistical models. Outside of class, I spend most of my time volunteering in EMS. I also like weightlifting, distance running, and cooking.
